# Musicord

The following is a platform-agnostic web app built at HackGT that creates collaborative playlists and plays music on multiple devices simultaneously with no latency.

It leverages Spotifyâ€™s machine learning APIs to recommend songs to dynamically generated rooms based on user defined preferences.

Musicord operates on a server- client model and web sockets created in Node.js. Utilizes firebase to catalog songs and track user preferences.
